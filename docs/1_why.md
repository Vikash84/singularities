# Why Singularity

[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) is a container solution
that provides some benefits for bioinformaticians:

* allows to install packages and tools without conflicts with the host system
* ensures reproducibility as using the same image should result in the same output

Compared with other containers:

* the image is an easily shareable file
* will run in user space (does not require _root_ priviledges)
* will seamlessly see your filesystem and can be used almost as a native tool would
