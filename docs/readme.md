# Singularity for Bioinformatics

Notes and scripts to make use of **singularity**
for reproducible bionformatics.

:package: See the **[repository](https://github.com/telatin/singularities)**

## Rationale

Singularity can be used to containerize software (and their dependencies)
for later use.

This repository contains notes on how to automate the generation of such
**containers** making use of the Miniconda installer (and the
**BioConda** channel).

The goal is to provide a **seamless** installation of tools, so we will cover
notes on how to write appropriate launchers.

```note
This repository is under development. Feel free to submit an issue if you
find it difficult to reproduce something.
